# Implement immutable infrastructure with Pulumi: Part I

![logo](images/ws-logo.png)

Welcome to the third workshop at the series of workshop dedicated to Infrastructure as Code tools and frameworks. During the first 2 workshops we learned what are ARM templates and how to use them. This time we will look at Pulumi - an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure you have completed the Workshop [prerequisites](prerequisites.md)

## Workshop goals

The goals for this workshop are:

* get started with Pulumi on Azure
* learn Pulumi concepts like projects, state, stacks, outputs
* learn how to use Azure services like Storage Account and Key Vault  to self-manage the state and secrets management
* learn how to adopt existing infrastructure into Pulumi
