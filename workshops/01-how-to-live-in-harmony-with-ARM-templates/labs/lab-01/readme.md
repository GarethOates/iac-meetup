# Lab-01 - initialize `az cli` environment and create resource groups

## Estimated completion time - 5 min

The goals for this lab are:

* initialize your `az cli` environment
* create 2 resource groups for `dev` and `prod` environments
* create Azure portal dashboard at the portal

 Also, please check our [naming conventions](../../naming-conventions.md) before  you start.

## Task #1 - initialize `az cli` environment

Fist, you need to login to your azure account

```bash
az login
```

You will be redirected to the browser where you will need to login with your azure account. Sometimes, you need manually copy code and enter it at this page [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin). Just follow the instructions.

```bash
$ az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code DMBKTZBJL to authenticate.
```

Next (and this step is optional), you need to set your active subscription.
To get list of available subscriptions, use this command

```bash
az account list -o table
```

Note, The `-o table` or `--output table` parameter switches the output to a more concise human-readable format.

To set subscription use this command. You can use both subscription id and subscription name as value for `--subscription` argument.

```bash
az account set --subscription       xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
or
az account set --subscription subscription_name
```

To check what is the current active subscription, use this command

```bash
az account show
```

## Tip #1

Every time you don't remember what `az` commands available or what are the arguments for the selected command, you can add `--help` attribute to get help. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Show list of all commands available
az --help

# Show list of subgroups and commands available under the group `resource`
az group --help

# Show list of arguments available for create resource group command
az group create --help
```

az cli support auto completion, just start typing command and press `Tab` and if command exists, it will be auto completed.

If you double `Tab`, az cli will show you list of commands or arguments available at the current context, sort of light version of `--help` flag.

## Tip #2

If you want to learn and experiment with `Ã z cli`, you can install [Azure CLI Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli) VS code plugin.

## Task #2 - create resource group for `dev` environment

Create resource group for `dev` environment.

```bash
az group create -n iac-dev-rg -l westeurope --tags owner=team-platform env=dev description="Workshop #1 resources for dev environment"
```

## Task #3 - create resource group for `prod` environment

Create resource group for `prod` environment.

```bash
az group create -n iac-prod-rg -l northeurope --tags owner=team-platform env=prod description="Workshop #1 resources for production environment" -o table
```

## Checkpoint for task #2 and #3

Make sure that your resource groups are created successfully:

```bash
az group exists -n iac-dev-rg
true
```

or visually check that both resource groups were created

```bash
az group list -o table
Name         Location    Status
-----------  ----------  ---------
iac-dev-rg   westeurope  Succeeded
iac-prod-rg  northeurope  Succeeded
```

## Task #4 (optional) - create Azure portal dashboard

Create Azure portal dashboard for newly created resource groups.

Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and create new dashboard followed by the [following instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards). Let's call this dashboard `IaC Lab #1`.

Find resource group `iac-dev-rg` and pin it to the dashboard by clicking pin icon ![pin](img/pin.png) at the top right corner of resource group window next to the close icon ![close](img/close.png).

Find resource group `iac-prod-rg` and pin it to the dashboard by clicking pin icon ![pin](img/pin.png) at the top right corner of resource group window next to the close icon ![close](img/close.png).

After you successfully done this, your dashboard should like this:
